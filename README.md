# react-tic-tac-toe

A rendition of the tic-tac-toe game from the [React tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) that includes all the basic features and the following extensions:

1. All of the improvements mentioned in the tutorial (eg. move locations and winning pieces)
2. 6-piece tic-tac-toe where "larger" pieces are allowed to be placed on top of "smaller" ones

Todo (probably better implemented as issues):
- [X] add move locations to history 
- [ ] bold current move
- [X] use loops to render board 
- [ ] add button/checkbox that will reverse history order
- [ ] winning move highlight
- [ ] add message for draw
- [ ] add multiple pieces and according logic
